# Ribot
## Dev Challenge

Oh hi. Do `npm install` to grab the dependencies. Run the express server on port 8008 with 'node ribot.js'.

### Grunt tasks

To build the client JavaScript bundle, run 'grunt build', this will also precompile any handlebars templates within /views/shared/ into a single AMD module for use on the client.

#### To do

* Remove ability to scroll entire viewport when section is focussed, instead, add scroll pane to inner area of each section.
* Twitter feed for each member.
* Loader graphic (module / functionality is already complete).
* Don't instantiate a new section every time it's opened.
* Testing testing testing (currently only tested on iOS).
